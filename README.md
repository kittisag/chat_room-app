Objective: A web-based, GraphQL-powered chat client

## How to Install and Run

1. open project and user 'yarn install'
2. enter to folder 'server' in project and 'yarn install'
3. in server terminal use 'yarn dev'

## Things need to do in the Future
- put PubSub Function to refresh the messages in chat room realtime (still learning how to implement it).
- still have some CSS  bugs to fix.
- need to refactor code for make it better.
